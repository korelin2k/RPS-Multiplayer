# RPS - Fortnite Style

### Rules
1. Wall beats Rocket Launcher
2. Rocket Launcher beats Clinger
3. Clinger beats Wall

### Notes & Comments
1. Create a user with your own unique avatar
2. There can be multiple games going on at once (multiplayer fun!)
3. Responsive design (play on your phone!)
4. Taunt your opponent with an in-game chat
5. Your "player-id" is saved in localstorage, so it "logs" you in the moment you launch the page. Stupid SSO!
